# S3InputsConfig

This config set up will provide you a Cromwell server on `gizmo` that submits jobs to `gizmo` and uses files in Fast/Scratch OR in AWS S3.  

NOTE:  This config requires that you have a set of AWS credentials in your home directory already set up for it to work.  See [SciWiki](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/scicomputing/access_credentials/#amazon-web-services-aws) to learn how to set this up via running a quick process on `rhino`.
