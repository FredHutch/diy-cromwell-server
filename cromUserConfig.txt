################## WORKING DIRECTORY AND PATH CUSTOMIZATIONS ###################
## Where do you want the working directory to be for Cromwell (note: this process will create a subdirectory here called "cromwell-executions")?  
### Suggestion: /fh/scratch/delete90/pilastname_f/username
SCRATCHDIR=/fh/scratch/delete90/...

## Where do you want logs about individual workflows (not jobs) to be written?
## Note: this is a default for the server and can be overwritten for a given workflow in workflow-options.
### Suggestion: /fh/fast/pilastname_f/cromwell/workflow-logs
WORKFLOWLOGDIR=~/cromwell-home/workflow-logs


## Where do you want to save Cromwell server logs for troubleshooting Cromwell itself?
### Suggestion: ~/home/username/cromwell-home/server-logs
SERVERLOGDIR=~/cromwell-home/server-logs

################ DATABASE CUSTOMIZATIONS #################
## DB4Sci MariaDB details (remove < and >, and use unquoted text, and no spaces after the = sign):

CROMWELLDBPORT=...
CROMWELLDBNAME=...
CROMWELLDBUSERNAME=...
CROMWELLDBPASSWORD=...

## Number of cores for your Cromwell server itself - usually 4 is sufficient.  
###Increase if you want to run many, complex workflows simultaneously or notice your server is slowing down.
NCORES=4
## Length of time you want the server to run for.  
### Note: when servers go down, all jobs they'd sent will continue.  When you start up a server the next time
### using the same database, the new server will pick up whereever the previous workflows left off.  "7-0" is 7 days, zero hours.
SERVERTIME="7-0"
